Input two different analog inputs to the ADC
module of Arduino, perform the mentioned operations and display the output
on a CRO. The first input should be from function generator and the second
input should be from any other input of your choice (e.g. potentiometer,
analog sensor, etc.). The operations are:
(i) Simple addition of the two input signals.
(ii) Subtract Signal 2 from Signal 1.
